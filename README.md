# texto_white_HamsterCMS_HTML4_theme
https://github.com/turboblack/HamsterCMS

this template is special in that it does not have any graphics, it is made exclusively of text symbols
the template works great on old browsers from the late 90s, such as IE5

Great for an old school project


To use a template, create an **texto_white** folder in the **templates** folder, copy index.html there, open the admin panel on the hosting, select the page, and specify this template in the options.

This is what this template looks like

I invite you to visit the hosting that runs on this CMS
